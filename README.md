# bulma-prefers-dark

A Bulma extension based on [jloh's bulma-prefers-dark repository](https://github.com/jloh/bulma-prefers-dark).
This fork adds support for dark mode  using the `bulma-dark-mode` class rather than the `prefers-color-scheme: dark` media query.

## Usage

This extension works as-is in combination with Bulma by adding an alternative dark theme via the `bulma-dark-mode` css class.

Compile it with: 
```bash
$ npm install # First time setup

$ npm run build
```
